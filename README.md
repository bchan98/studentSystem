This program was written in C++ in Visual Studio Code.

This program was written as an excercise to implement a student roster system in C++. A set of strings with various student information of data is provided. The program must be able to then parse the data and be able to detect various aspects from the data, such as invalid emails or any typos. Additionally, the program should be able to make various calls to calculate average days remaining in a set of courses. 

The student and student roster are implemented as separate classes, and then the roster is stored in a single array. All information is outputted into console. The program itself intakes data from a set of strings, with no input from the user neccessary.
